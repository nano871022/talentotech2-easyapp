# Notes:
# - Copy this file to .env and modify values as needed
# - DB_HOST should be 'db' when running with docker-compose (service name)
# - DB_HOST should be 'localhost' or actual host when running locally
# - The auth-service and advise-service will read these values from container environment variables
# - Environment variables set in docker-compose.yml take priority over .env file values
